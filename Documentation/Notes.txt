Things to accomplish on this project / ideas / stuff like thatâ€¦ YAY!

Scape: A futuristic hacking game that closely follows the Diablo formula!  LOOT AND XP FOR THE WIN

Damage system:
	For the player:
		Defense rating
		Attack rating
		Weapon modifiers
		Skill modifiers
		Level
			Modifies skill levels
			Modifies Defense and Attack ratings
	For NPCs:
		Defense rating
		Attack rating
		Level
			Modifies Defense and attack ratings

Skills:
	Slot for attack type (Which determines the behaviour of the attack
		Examples:
			Short range melee
			Long range raycast
			Long/short range projectiles
			Special thing like
				Bounce shots
				Whilwinds
				Maybe pets
	Slot for damage or damage types
		Balance between attack and defense
		Damage types (If/when we ever have them)
	Passive skill system/slots

Connections:
Levels:
	Each level increases attack and defense ratings (For NPC and Player)
		Each level may also modify skills in some way (For player)
			My initial thought is simply Diablo 2 style skill levels
				Place the point where you want it each level
	For enemies, each enemy should be tweakable to have different amounts of attack/defense per level; so we can make tougher enemies that spawn at the same level
	
Attack/defense ratings:
	Modified by (Player):
		Level
		Equipment
		Permanent/temporary items (consumables)
		Skills/Passive skills
		Debuffs
	Modified by (Enemies):
		Per-level increases of attack/defense (tweak-able per enemy)
		Debuffs

equipmentDamage is a RANGE, so there's a random roll involved (Think 4-7 damage)

baseDamage = equipmentDamage * levelDamageBonusPercentage + any other bonuses (Skills, etc)

skills: need percentage modifier (To balance AOE/DOT with direct damage)

Player Damage = baseDamage * (playerAttackRating/enemyDefenseRating)

Criticals/Critical rate

For future use/expansion:
	Enemies carrying/using weapons
	Damage types (Like Fire/Water, but with computer equivalents)
		This also means we'd need Defense ratings per damage type
	I like synergy bonuses - but we might not have them
